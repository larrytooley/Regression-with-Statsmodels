# Automating Regression at Caterpillar with Statsmodels

## Description:

Caterpillar Reman Powertrain Indiana (Franklin, IN) needed to create regression models for more than 4000 parts in order to improve inventory performance. This session will demonstrate some of the code used to clean and organize data in preparation to create the regression models. Additionally, the differences between scikit-learn's and StatsModels' regression functionality will be compared and why I chose StatsModels.
